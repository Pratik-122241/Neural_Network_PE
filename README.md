A hardware implementation of a neural network processing element (PE) designed in Verilog for FPGA deployment using Xilinx Vivado. This project features a configurable processing unit optimized for neural network computations including multiply-accumulate operations, activation functions, and data flow control.

Key Features:
- Parameterizable data width and precision
- Pipelined multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations  
- Integrated activation function support (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- AXI4-Stream interface compatibility
- Optimized for Xilinx FPGA architectures
- Comprehensive testbench suite
- Timing-optimized design for high-frequency operation

Architecture:
The PE core implements a systolic array-style processing element with dedicated input/output buffers, weight storage, and bias addition capabilities. The design supports both fixed-point and configurable precision arithmetic for efficient resource utilization.
